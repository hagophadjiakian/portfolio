    title: 'Passive Knee Exoskeleton & surface Electromyography device',
    description: 'University final year project on assistive biomechanics',
    details: `As part of my final year project at university, with the help of my colleagues we designed and built a passive knee exoskeleton.
It was developed with the goal of providing mechanical support to individuals with lower limb weakness,
using spring-loaded joints to reduce muscular effort during movement.

This project combined my interest in biomechanics and my determination to create practical solutions for mobility/for movement.`,

    title: 'EMG-Controlled Motor Activation Device',
    description: 'Muscle-driven control system for motors using EMG signals',
    details: `This device is designed to convert muscle activity into mechanical motion by using electromyography (EMG) signals to control a motor.

When a user voluntarily contracts specific muscles, surface EMG sensors detect the electrical signals generated by that activity. These signals are then amplified, filtered, and processed in real-time by a microcontroller.

Once the EMG signal exceeds a predefined threshold—indicating intentional muscle contraction—the system sends a command to activate a motor. This motor can be used to drive an external mechanical component, such as a robotic joint, a rehabilitation device, or a prosthetic mechanism.

The system enables intuitive, muscle-based control of assistive technology, allowing users to interact with or control devices using their natural muscle signals. It is particularly useful for applications in neurorehabilitation, prosthetics, and wearable robotics.`,

    title: 'Homemade Neurological Rehabilitation Devices',
    description: 'Custom-built assistive tools for SCI recovery and muscle stimulation',
    details: `This project showcases a series of DIY rehabilitation devices I built to support my own neurological recovery journey as a spinal cord injury survivor.

• A passive and active cycling device designed to stimulate leg movement and prevent joint stiffness.

• A custom-built ankle mobilization system allowing controlled plantarflexion and dorsiflexion, aimed at reducing muscle atrophy and preserving range of motion.

• A therapeutic hydrostimulation setup that delivers warm water to my legs to promote blood circulation and relieve muscle tension.

These devices are born out of necessity, creativity, and determination to improve physical function using accessible, low-cost tools.`,
